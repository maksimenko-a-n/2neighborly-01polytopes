# 2neighborly-01polytopes
Database of 2-neighborly 0/1-polytopes of dimension 7

The description of the database is in Manual.pdf.
For using the database, you need to unpack 6d.zip or/and 7d.zip.
The file 6d.fv contains all f-vectors of 2-neighborly 0/1-polytopes in dimension 6.
You can read the database by using C-program read.c (with rwdb.c and rwdb.h).
The file 7d.fv is packed into the archive 7d-fv.zip. It contains all f-vectors for 7-polytopes.
We don't upload to the repository entire database for dimension 7, since it needs about 1TB.
The archive 6d-10d-max-vertices.zip contains examples of 2-neighborly 0/1-polytopes with the maximal number of vertices (for every dimension from 6 to 10).
